#  Mathematical Modeling of Measles Spread Using the SIR Model
This project focuses on creating a mathematical model to simulate the spread of a measles in a population. Here, SIR model is used which is a compartmental model that divides the population into three categories:  Susceptible (S), Infected (I),  Recovered (R).
